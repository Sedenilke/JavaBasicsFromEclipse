What is an object:
Everything around us is an object. Keyboard, mouse, a glass of water, etc.
Objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave.
Objects in computer programming are also very similar.
They have state (which helps us define how that object looks like) and behaviors (what that object does)

What is a Class?
---Class a template which we create the objects.
 
Object Oriented programming:
it is just a way of writing programs. It is just the one way to write the programs. There are some other ones. Structured. He said.


--Why we should learn OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
1) It simplifies the development of large programs.
2) It will also help us maintain and modify the existing code.
3) It helps us write more secure codes
4) It helps us avoid duplicate code.

OOP has 4 main pillars:
1. Classes and objects
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Encapsulation

!!! we should not define another behavior inside another one!!!

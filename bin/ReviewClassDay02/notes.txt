Type casting:
Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another one.We have two types of type casting.
1)Explicit/narrowing/manual: When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called. Burada tam sonucu yakalayamiyoruz
java random bir deger atiyor sigdiramadigi icin.

2)Implicit/widening/automatic: When we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it/
byte(8 bits) --> short(16 bits), char (16 bits) -->int(32 bits) --> long (64 bits)
float (32 bits[burada scientefic notationi acikladik, bunun bit'i long'dan kucuk olmasina ragmen neden daha buyuk bu
onun aciklamasi.
cunku 3.2E90 seklinde gosterebilirim.] --> double (64 bits)

Why do we need type casting?
When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types.
when we are working with numbers some time we just need the whole part of the numbers, not the decimal parts.

What is the syntax?
Explicit:
int box = 1000;
byte box2 = (byte) box1;

Implicit:
short box1 = 250;
int box2 = box1;

----------------------------------
if statement:
if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on some condition provided data.
if condition
if else condition
if else if condition
nested if else condition.		

--------------------------------------
if data type was primitive then we use "==" if it is string we use (equal)

		 * Similar to if else if conditions. Why we should learn about the switch case?
		 * 1. It is cleaner code. 2. It is faster than if conditions. 3. Switch works
		 * with boxes, we talked about hash function. It only works with int, short,
		 * char, String - we cannot use boolean it holds only 2 values, too small for
		 * switch double is tooo big, it does not give an actual solution, accuracy will
		 * be a problem. If we want to choose between if else and switch, we always need
		 * to go with switch.

Arrays are consecutive memory locations which store same type of data.
Why we need arrays?
-help us to store large amount of data in a single variable. For example if we want to store the data of 100 students, we do not 
need to create 100 different variables.
We can simply create an array of size 100 and it will store the names.

Syntax(How to use)
First option: Data type []  name of array = new data type [size]
Second option: Data type [] name of array = new data type [] { store the elements}
For example an int array that stores three numbers 
int [] arr =new int [] { 10,20,3}

  // prints all the elements of an array without a loop
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(dresses));
        
 //limitation of enhanced loop:
 we can only go in one direction
 we can not skipped the elements
 we cannot use enhanced for loop to update the elements in an array
 we can only use it to access the elements.
 


How can we find the index of one element in an array?

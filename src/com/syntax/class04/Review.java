		/* Type Casting(Only for primitives)
		 * Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
		 * For example we can convert a short to byte, a long to float etc.
		 * There are two main types:
		 * implicit/widening/automatic and --> When Java converts the data types automatically for us.
		 * It only happens when we assign a smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this conversion.
		 * explicit/narrowing/Manual -->When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called explicit/narrowing/manual.
		 * It does not happen automatically we have to do it explicitly Manually.
		 * Why we should learn type casting?
		 * When we write code in our real life most of the time we use the code from others to save time and we might also need to convert
		 * the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
		 * What is the syntax for type casting?
		 * We use () and inside the () we write the destination data type for example if we want to convert a long 
		 * to an int this is how we can do it.
		 * long var1 = 250;
		 * int var2 = int (var1) --> explicit type
		 * double var3 = var2 --> implicit type
		 * float f = 250.5f;
		 * double d = f; --> implicit type
		 * 
		 * if else condition
		 * if else conditions help us write code that can take decision based on data.
		 * Why should we learn about if else?
		 * Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our programs 
		 * need to make a lot of decisions.
		 * if (given username and password match) { go to the home page}
		 * else { give user a warning}
		 * What is the syntax for if else condition 
		 * boolean  isHungry = true;
		 * if (isHungry) {
		 * System.out.println("Please eat something");
		 * else { System.out.println("Lets build some java programs"); }

 String does not allow to change to change the original contents of the variables
 because String is immutable
 
StringBuilder  allows any methods to change the original contents of the variables
because StringBuilder is mutable.

Every time that we create a variable with String, Java scan all the memory whether it saved the same value before.
if it did, it assigns the new created variable to the same id (memory place) with the first created one.
which means it saves memory, but it takes time to process to go over all of those values.

 StringBuilder does not do it. It creates a new variable every single time.
 even though same value has been stored before.
 If we focus on speed, and not care about memory we go with StringBuilder,

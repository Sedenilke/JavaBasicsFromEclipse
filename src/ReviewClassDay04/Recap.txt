Loops:
Loops in Java help us execute a piece of code again and again.
----------------------------------------
Why should we learn about loop?
Because loops help us write cleaner and scalable code. 
For example if you have to test password field on a webpage you can create different variation of data
in excel sheet then you pick all the values one by one and test the field.
-----------------------------------------
How many types of loops?
1. For loops:
for(starting point; ending point; step size) {
-----code that we want to repeat-----
}
2. While loops -- I can write everything that I write for "for loop" with while loop.They are interchangeable.
Sometimes it makes logic sense. Sometimes using while loop makes more sense than using for loop.
